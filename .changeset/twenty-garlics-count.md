Changed how Contentful ID is created.

Previously, Saleor's ID was used to create entry in Contentful. 
However, this implementation was failing when special characters in ID occurred (like "=="). 

Now, entry in Contentful is created using it's own system ID, generated by Contentful itself.

App will first query entries via variant ID field, so it still works without a breaking change.

It's recommended to set "unique" parameter on variant ID field
