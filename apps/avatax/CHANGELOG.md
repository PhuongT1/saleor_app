# app-avatax

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a4d35fe8: Removed "Client Logs" feature. It was effectively breaking taxes calculation, because it performed heavy data+network operations during short time period of a webhook execution.

### Patch Changes

- c6e6c1f2: Cleanup `WebhookResponse.error` function - now it won't capture exception to Sentry. Instead you should use `Sentry.captureException` explicitly when there is unhandled exception.
- e3c44c5e: Changed maximum timeout on Avatax client calls to 15s from 5s

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b29318a2: Currently, Dashboard requires from a user to have "MANAGE_APPS" to have access to the apps tab.
  Since the release 3.20 Dashboard will allow all users to access to apps tabs without checking permission.
  This means that apps will be checking if the user has "MANAGE_APPS" internally and show message "You do not have permission to access this page" if the user does not have the permission.
- 0f1a38d1: Avatax app will now send `productVariantId` from `OrderLine` to Avatax if there is no `productSku` while processing `ORDER_CREATED` webhook.

### Patch Changes

- 4a898bfa: Add `issuedAt` and `version` fields to GraphQL subscriptions. This enhance our logs with debug information.
- 23a57e21: Avatax app now uses shipping address for order tax calculations
- Updated dependencies [b29318a2]

- 3d5d17a0: Add handling of WrongChannelError for OrderConfirmed event. Now false-positive error will not be thrown

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- fa478d2b: Gracefully handle cases, where checkout/order in webhooks misses address and/or lines. These scenarios are possible when app is reached with partial checkout/order. It can happen when user haven't yet entered address or added lines. App will check this and return proper error with status 400
- 1e07a6ff: Applied "logger context" that allows api handlers to share fields in the invocation context. It helps to avoid "prop drilling". This context will be sent with Open Telemetry logs attributes
- cb620765: Unified the shipping line logic. Reading and creating a shipping line is now in `avatax-shipping-line.ts`.
- Updated dependencies [1e07a6ff]
  - @saleor/apps-logger@1.2.0
