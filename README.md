## Overview

This repository serves as a starting point in the exploration of Saleor apps.

> _Saleor apps are separate applications that use GraphQL to talk to the Saleor server and receive webhooks with event notifications from Saleor._

- [üÜï Quickstart Tutorial](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/quickstart/getting-started) - to build your first app using [Saleor CLI](https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/cli).
- [üóìÔ∏è Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/saleor/projects/22/views/1) - to see the current progress on the development of official Saleor apps.
- [‚úçÔ∏è GitHub issues](https://github.com/saleor/apps/discussions/categories/integrations-features) - to submit a proposal for creating a new integration or an app.

## Development

1. Ensure `pnpm` is installed
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm dev` to run all apps dev servers. Ports will be displayed in the terminal output
4. Run `pnpm dev --filter=saleor-app-X` where X is app name (matching saleor/X)
5. Run `pnpm build` to build all apps
6. Visit `apps/NAME/README.MD` for documentation of each app
7. Visit `apps/NAME/.env.example` for example, env variables requires by each app


## Forking

Saleor provides apps out of the box in Saleor Cloud plans, but all apps are open source and can be used
under the [BSD-3 license](./LICENSE). 

Using monorepo with multiple apps may be confusing - you probably need only one app, but repository contains all of them.

You can still fork and be able to track and merge the original source code with two strategies:

### Delete unused apps

The repository contains apps and shared packages which are imported by apps. Apps never import other apps,
so they can be safely deleted.

You can delete all apps except the one you need. Turborepo setup will automatically run all scripts only on the single package you have left,
but it can be additionally filtered with `turbo run SCRIPT --filer=saleor-app-NAME`

We recommend keeping other files to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

If you want to update the repository, you can still merge or rebase it with the original source code. 
You may face conflicts for apps folders you don't have anymore, but they can be easily discarded during conflict resolution.
Just delete them again!

### Keep everything

To avoid conflicts to a minimum, you can leave other apps and just ignore them. These tips can help you with a single app experience:
- Mark other apps folders as "excluded" in your IDE to avoid indexing these files
- Run your scripts with Turborepo filters, e.g. `turbo run SCRIPT --filer=saleor-app-NAME`
- Use pnpm to avoid duplicated packages. Pnpm installs packages once and links them, which causes minimal performance overhead of node_modules
